# Authentication

## Introduction

Authentication can be a feat as simple or as complex as you want it to be. In-built authentication can be the easiest (so long as you accept that you store user's passwords, albeit hashed), and there are some systems where this is ideal -- think small single-user applications.

!!! tip "Context is everything"
    If you don't need to implement an advanced authentication mechanism, don't! Keep it simple now, and add complexity later if you need it. Remember, it's easier to add complexity than it is to remove it. Keeping it simple also means there's less to go wrong!
